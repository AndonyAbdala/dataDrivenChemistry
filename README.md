# The Idea

Quantum chemistry is a branch of theoretical chemistry which applies quantum mechanics  to address problems in chemistry.

In Quantum Chemistry you can calculate a molecule on a computer, simulating and solving the Schr√∂dinger equation to obtain molecular properties.
Chemoinformatics

An open question is: **How can we incorporate quantum effects/information into chemoinformatics?**
Recently in Ramakrishnan et Al. reported in Nature Scientific Data, ["Quantum chemistry structures and properties of 134 kilo molecules"](http://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201422) a data set 134k calculated molecules. 

# Data

Dataset is hosted on http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.978904, it is a few hundred MB's.
I also have pandas dataframe pickle in my dropbox:

Results of each calculation has been embeded within a xyz file in a very specific way. The data provided by the article is not very user friendly ( see: http://www.ch.imperial.ac.uk/rzepa/blog/?p=12803), a better format would have been a json or excel database.

They reported computed geometric, energetic, electronic, and thermodynamic properties for 134k stable small organic molecules made up of CHONF atoms.
