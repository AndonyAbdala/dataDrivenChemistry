The data provided by the article is not very user friendly ( see: http://www.ch.imperial.ac.uk/rzepa/blog/?p=12803), a better format would have been a json or excel database.\r\n\r\nThey reported computed geometric, energetic, electronic, and thermodynamic properties for 134k stable small organic molecules made up of CHONF atoms.\r\n# Exploration Visualization\r\nThe variables to explore were:\r\n* Size: Number of atoms, Molecular Weight, Spatial Extensivity.\r\n* Rotation: Rotational Constants and Clases.\r\n* Energetics: Internal energy, Enthalpy, Gibbs free energy, Zero Point Energy, Atomization Energies.\r\n* Special Properties: Electronic Band Gap, Molar Heat Capacity, Dipole Moment and Polarizability\r\n\r\n# Finding Patterns\r\nI did explore matching molecules based on similarity. \r\nFor example taking 1000 random molecules and checking out how similar they were (geometry/structure wise)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis goal, which is the most interesting was not met due to time constraints.\r\nThe main idea was:\r\n* Search the most common functional groups, chemical substructures that contain key chemical functionality. For this purpose I wanted to use RDKit, but had problems running it. Tried to think how to formulate this with a Kmeans classifier.\r\n* Create a labeling for each molecule based on a molecule having the substructure or not. This would create a membership of a molecule to within different clusters.\r\n* Reduce dimentionality, maybe with a TruncatedSVD or finding the best features by ranking their importance via a random forest classifier.\r\n* See if membership into a cluster would correspond to general differences in the molecular properties.\r\n* Use SVM/Random Forest to create a classifier of molecular substructure based on molecular properties.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Future Directions\r\nThere is certaintly much more work to be done and many venues to explore with data science and Quantum Chemistry.\r\nFor the msot part I stuck to the available dataset, yet I feel there could be more interesting data embedded in the calculations which is not included in the data set.\r\nExamples:\r\n* **Frequencies**, only frequencies were reported but amplitudes were not. Using amplitudes and frequencies together you could devise spectra features such as spectral centroids, brightness o cSpectrum.\r\n* **Coulombic Matrix**, The matrix of electromagnetic interaction between different\r\nmolecules.\r\n* **Orbital Occupation Numbers**, Occupation numbers for the electrons within the molecular orbitals.\r\n\r\nThe main idea would be design and find descriptor that can not be found in a classical way, to demonstrate that a quantum calculation has more conection to reality than a classical one. (at the molecular level).\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://giant.gfycat.com/FairWaryBactrian.gif\">\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
